"One of the things I love about Outer Wilds is the way it handles its story.
Technically, you *could* beat the game as soon as you leave your planet.
All you need is already set up, no locked doors. It was all there are soon as it started.
You don't *need* to understand the story to use those parts, but the story is what
tells you that they can be used, and what they might be used for. It's all a matter of recontextualizing what you've already seen.
And I love that." - Tyler
